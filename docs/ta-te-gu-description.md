These datasets are the same as the ones used in Interspeech 2018 Special Session: Low Resource Speech Recognition Challenge for Indian Languages (Interspeech 2018 Special Session: Low Resource Speech Recognition Challenge for Indian Languages - Microsoft Research). All the three datasets consist of 40 and 5 hours of speech in the train and test sets, respectively. The audio files are sampled at 16 kHz, 16 bit encoding.</p>
