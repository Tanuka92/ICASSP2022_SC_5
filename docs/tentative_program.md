    <p><strong>Title: </strong>Speech Processing: Handcrafted features to Deep Representations</p>
  <p><strong>Abstract: </strong>With the advent of deep learning to the speech processing field for about a decade, a lot of attempts have been made towards learning the representations from spectrographic representation of speech. These representations are based on nonlinear processing and
seem to capture more information from speech. The other mostly practised approach is handcrafted features extracted using signal processing and linked to speech production and/or perception. These approaches are mostly based on linear processing and are mathematically tractable.  This talk will take through the journey of speech processing from earliest explorations of handcrafted features to the latest deep representations. </p>

    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Overview of Speech Recognition Technology in Conversational Agents</p>
  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> From the early days of modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) research in the 1990s, one of the driving visions of the field has been a computer-based assistant that could accomplish tasks for the user, simply by being spoken to. Today, we are close to achieving that vision, with a whole array of speech-enabled AI agents eager to help users. Amazonâ€™s Alexa pioneered the AI assistant concept for smart speaker devices enabled by far-field ASR. It currently supports billions of customer interactions per week, on over 100 million devices across multiple languages. This talk will give an overview of the interplay between underlying speech technologies, including wakeword detection, endpointing, speaker identification, and speech recognition that enable Alexa. We highlight successes and challenges in developing large-scale ASR, and dive into the unique data aspects of large-scale deployments like Alexa, where a continuous stream of unlabeled data enables successful applications of semi-supervised learning. Finally, we highlight problems that remain to be solved before the promise of a fully natural, conversational assistant is fully realized.</p>
