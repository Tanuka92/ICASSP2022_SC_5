  <li style="font-size:16.5px;">Participants can only use the audio and transcriptions provided to build their systems. Participants are free to use data given for both sub-tasks to build models for any of the sub-tasks.</li>
  <li style="font-size:16.5px;">If registered participants feel that they cannot submit a system, they will have to submit a withdrawal clause that states that they will not use the data for any other purposes. Only participants who submit systems to the challenge will be allowed to use the data in the future for research purposes.</li>
