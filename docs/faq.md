<br>
<p style="font-size:16.5px;">Q. For sub-task 1, baseline recipe is Kaldi based. Can participants use other model, e.g., end-to-end?</p>
<p style="font-size:16.5px;">A. Yes.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:16.5px;">Q. Can data from one subtask be used for the other subtask?</p>
<p style="font-size:16.5px;">A. Yes.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:16.5px;">Q. Can acoustic data other than the data released for this challenge be used for any of the subtasks?</p>
<p style="font-size:16.5px;">A. No.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:16.5px;">Q. How many trial submissions are allowed for the blind test set?</p>
<p style="font-size:16.5px;">A. Five. If more than five are submitted, sixth and above submissions will not be accepted.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:16.5px;">Q. Are participants allowed to use any data-augmentation technique on the released data, for example, speech rate modification, noise addition etc.?</p>
<p style="font-size:16.5px;">A. Yes (not violating <a href="https://navana-tech.github.io/IS21SS-indicASRchallenge/rules.html">Challenge Rules</a>), as long as the details of the technique or resources are made publicly available.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:16.5px;">Q. Are participants allowed to use pre-trained acoustic or language models or any other models in system building?</p>
<p style="font-size:16.5px;">A. Yes. Please refer to <a href="https://navana-tech.github.io/IS21SS-indicASRchallenge/rules.html">Challenge Rules</a>.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:16.5px;">Q. Can a participant submit more than one model's hypothesis? Will that count for the max five submission? If a participant wants to try two different models, will five submissions from each of them be allowed?</p>
<p style="font-size:16.5px;">A. No, overall five submissions are allowed irrespective of how many models a participant tries on his/her end.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:16.5px;">Q. If a group of individuals is participating in the challenge as a team do they mention everyone's details in the name and email address field (during registration) or just one of us would suffice?</p>
<p style="font-size:16.5px;">A. Just one will do. We suggest to mention these details of the key contact person of the team.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:16.5px;">Q. For code-mixing challenge, for English , can we use external English ASR data, example - Librispeech as  additional data?</p>
<p style="font-size:16.5px;">A. Yes (not violating <a href="https://navana-tech.github.io/IS21SS-indicASRchallenge/rules.html">Challenge Rules</a>, as long as the data is (made) publicly available.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:16.5px;">Q. If someone wants to use transliteration for some model, can he/she use an open source transliteration tool, which is already published elsewhere and available on GitHub publicly or that might be trained on external data?</p>
<p style="font-size:16.5px;">A. Yes (not violating <a href="https://navana-tech.github.io/IS21SS-indicASRchallenge/rules.html">Challenge Rules</a>), as long as the details of the technique or resources are (made) publicly available.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:16.5px;">Q. Can a participant build his/her own lexicon?</p>
<p style="font-size:16.5px;">A. Yes (not violating <a href="https://navana-tech.github.io/IS21SS-indicASRchallenge/rules.html">Challenge Rules</a>), as long as the details of the technique or resources are (made) publicly available.</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:16.5px;">Q. Will the challenge participants of the sub-task1 be informed from which language each of the blind test set audios are taken?</p>
<p style="font-size:16.5px;">A. No. Sub-task1 is on multilingual ASR. Hence, language information for the blind test set wonâ€™t be provided.</p>
