<h2> Challenge Rules [tentative] </h2>

<ul>
<li>Participants can only use the audio and transcriptions provided to build their systems. They can choose to use the corresponding languageâ€™s data to build each system or combine the data and use it cross-lingually.
</li>

<li>Participants are expected to sign an agreement when they download the data and are expected to use the data only for research purposes. Participants who register but do not submit a system to the challenge are required to withdraw from the challenge.
</li>

<li>If registered participants feel that they cannot submit a system, they will have to submit a withdrawal clause that states that they will not use the data for any other purposes. Only participants who submit systems to the challenge will be allowed to use the data in the future for research purposes.
</li>

<li>The systems submitted are expected to beat the baseline system in terms of WER, however, innovative systems that come close to the baseline may be considered.
</li>

<li>Only the audio for the blind test set (5 hours) will be released. Participants are expected to run their systems on the blind test set and submit the ASR hypotheses to us for evaluation. Participants will need to share their final ASR model, along with the paper to be able to reproduce the hypotheses against the blind set.
</li>

</ul>
